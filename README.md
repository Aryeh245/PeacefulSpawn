####

This is a rewrite of the old peacefulspawn that is now outdated. I dont know if i am going to be constantly on updating this and if any issues or if any coding is a problem let me know. i am only a beginner at coding.

## Commands/Perms
* peacefulspawn.toggle
* peacefulspawn
* to enable or disable spawn protection, you use /ps
* to change the protection size. Next search for the server settings config file in your configs. In server settings look for Protected Spawn Size. The number next to it is the radius. Change it to RADIUS (not diameter) of your spawn.

## More detail

Hope you like the plugin and again please report any bugs in issues and if you know how to fix it please let me know. Again i am only a beginner coder. Thx
